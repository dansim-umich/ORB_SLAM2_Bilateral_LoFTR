# Implementing Bilateral Filter & LoFTR in ORB-SLAM2

This code was made using the [ORB SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2) and [LoFTR](https://github.com/zju3dv/LoFTR) Repositories.

This was a final project for ROB 530 at the University of Michigan

# Premise
This project attempts to modify **ORB-SLAM2** via two methods: **bilateral filter** and **LoFTR** embedding.

# ORB SLAM2
ORB-SLAM2 is an open source images-based SLAM method

# Bilateral Filter
A Bilateral Filter reduces noise in an image by reducing information entropy. A detailed readme could be found under Bilateral_fiter directory 

# LoFTR
LoFTR, Local Feature Mapping with Transformers, is a neural network that matches features between images.

# Installation
ORB-SLAM2 and LOFTR are kept separate to maintain simplicity

To Install ORB-SLAM2 enter the ORB_SLAM2 folder and follow the included README
